# Web3 Managed Funds Platform

A decentralized fund management platform built on Solana, allowing users to create investment funds, invest in existing funds, and execute transparent trades through Jupiter DEX.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This is a monorepo containing:
- **Frontend**: Next.js React application (`apps/web`)
- **Backend**: TypeScript API server (`apps/backend`)
- **Solana Program**: Anchor-based smart contracts (`programs/managed-funds`)
- **Shared Types**: Common TypeScript definitions (`packages/shared`)

## üîê Security Model

**Key Security Features:**
- **No Master Private Key**: Each user maintains control of their own wallet
- **Fund Manager Permissions**: Only fund creators can execute trades
- **Proportional Withdrawals**: Users can only withdraw their percentage of fund assets
- **Transparent Operations**: All trades are recorded on-chain and auditable
- **Jupiter Integration**: Trades are executed through Jupiter's verified program only

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Install Rust and Solana CLI
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs/ | sh
   sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.18.0/install)"
   
   # Install Anchor
   npm install -g @coral-xyz/anchor-cli
   
   # Install Node.js dependencies
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Copy environment template
   cp .env.example .env.local
   
   # Add your Helius API key to .env.local
   HELIUS_API_KEY=your_helius_devnet_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Generate Solana Keypair:**
   ```bash
   solana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/id.json
   solana config set --keypair ~/.config/solana/id.json
   solana config set --url devnet
   
   # Airdrop SOL for testing
   solana airdrop 2
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Start Development Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Build and deploy Solana program
   anchor build
   anchor deploy
   
   # Start backend API
   npm run dev --workspace=@managed-funds/backend
   
   # Start frontend
   npm run dev --workspace=apps/web
   ```

2. **Key Development Commands:**
   ```bash
   # Build all packages
   npm run build
   
   # Run tests
   npm run test
   
   # Lint code
   npm run lint
   
   # Clean build artifacts
   npm run clean
   ```
